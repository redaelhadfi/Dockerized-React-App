Given that the table will feed a reaction AI, the columns should emphasize aspects of the video that inform contextual understanding and trigger meaningful reactions. Here's an optimized breakdown:

Essential Columns for Reaction AI:
1. timestamp (Key Column):
    * Core reference for aligning reactions with specific video moments.
2. transcript:
    * Provides spoken content for understanding the narrative.
    * Enables linguistic reactions based on dialogue or keywords.
3. keywords:
    * Highlights significant terms or phrases.
    * Helps AI focus on recurring themes or important mentions for dynamic reactions.
4. sentiments:
    * Indicates emotional tone (e.g., neutral, positive, negative).
    * Guides emotional alignment for the AI's reactions.
5. emotions:
    * Detects specific emotions (e.g., joy, anger).
    * Triggers more nuanced and human-like reactions.
6. faces:
    * Identifies individuals in the video and their presence duration.
    * Facilitates reactions based on participants (e.g., greeting, commenting on appearances).
7. audioEffects:
    * Provides details like silence, applause, or background music.
    * Helps the AI adapt its reactions (e.g., excitement during applause or calm during silence).
8. topics:
    * Categorizes overarching themes (e.g., science, music).
    * Sets the contextual stage for informed reactions.
9. scenes and shots:
    * Highlights visual transitions.
    * Enables scene-based reactions (e.g., commenting on a cut to a new environment).
10. statistics:
    * Offers data like speaker word counts or dominant speakers.
    * Enables reactions acknowledging participation dynamics (e.g., “Speaker 1 is talking a lot!”).

Optional but Contextually Relevant:
1. ocr:
    * On-screen text can offer additional context.
    * Use if the AI needs to react to visible text (e.g., titles, subtitles).
2. namedLocations and namedPeople:
    * Adds contextual layers by identifying mentioned places or people.
    * Use for reactions about specific entities.

Columns to Exclude or Use Sparingly:
1. detectedObjects:
    * Generic objects are less relevant unless the AI needs to react visually to them.
2. blocks:
    * Too granular and unlikely to inform meaningful reactions.
3. textualContentModeration:
    * Useful only for filtering inappropriate content, not for dynamic reactions.
4. labels:
    * Often duplicates information from keywords and topics.
